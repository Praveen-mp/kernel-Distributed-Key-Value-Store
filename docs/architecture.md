# Architecture of My Kernel Module

This document describes the architecture of the kernel module, including its components and interactions with the Linux kernel.

## Overview

The kernel module is designed to provide a simple interface for interacting with the kernel. It consists of the following components:

1. **Module Initialization and Cleanup**: The module includes functions for initialization and cleanup, which are executed when the module is loaded and unloaded, respectively.

2. **Functionality**: The module can include various functionalities, such as handling system calls, managing resources, or interacting with hardware.

3. **Header File**: The header file provides necessary declarations for the functions and data structures used within the module.

## Components

- **my_module.c**: This source file contains the implementation of the kernel module. It includes the initialization function `my_module_init` and the cleanup function `my_module_exit`.

- **my_module.h**: This header file contains declarations for the functions used in the module, ensuring proper linkage and access to the module's functionality.

## Interaction with the Kernel

The module interacts with the Linux kernel through the use of kernel APIs. It utilizes the `printk` function for logging messages to the kernel log, which can be viewed using `dmesg`.

## Build Process

The module is built using a Makefile that leverages the kernel build system. The Makefile specifies the necessary rules for compiling the module against the currently running kernel.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a foundation for developing kernel modules in Linux, allowing for extensibility and interaction with the kernel's core functionalities.
